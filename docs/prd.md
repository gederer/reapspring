*Generated using BMAD Core Product Requirements Template v2.0*

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Launch functional reapSpring platform by October 1, 2025 to capture REAP FY 2026 application surge
• Enable 10,000 solar installer companies to pivot from residential to commercial markets through AI-powered REAP automation
• Process 10,000+ REAP applications within first 12 months generating $500K revenue at $50 per application
• Reduce REAP application costs by 97% (from $1,500-3,500 to $50) and time by 95% (from 2 weeks to 2-4 hours)
• Implement professional delegation system enabling SME owners to leverage trusted accountants, advisors, and engineers
• Achieve 85%+ federal approval rate for platform-generated applications through AI optimization and compliance validation
• Onboard 2,500+ consultants and serve 50,000+ rural SMEs who previously couldn't afford consultant fees

### Background Context
The solar industry faces an imminent crisis: the expiration of the 30% federal residential tax credit will force approximately 10,000 installer companies to pivot toward commercial markets where REAP grants provide 25% cost-share funding (up to $1M per project). With REAP FY 2026 applications opening October 1, 2025 - exactly 25 days away - the current consultant workforce of 15,000-50,000 professionals lacks the specialized knowledge to serve this market transition. Existing REAP consultants charge $1,500-3,500 per application with 1-2 week turnaround times, creating insurmountable barriers for the 6+ million qualifying rural SMEs. reapSpring solves this market failure through AI-powered application generation with a unique professional delegation system that enables SME owners to invite their trusted accountants, advisors, and engineers to provide specific data sections securely, ensuring both compliance and leveraging existing professional relationships.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
reapSpring prioritizes **guided simplicity** over feature complexity, recognizing that rural SME owners and solar consultants need immediate productivity without extensive learning curves. The interface embraces a **progressive disclosure** approach where complex features (professional delegation, manager oversight, payment routing) are revealed contextually rather than overwhelming users upfront. The design philosophy centers on **trust-building transparency** - every step of the REAP application process is visible and understandable, countering rural users' skepticism of "black box" government systems.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Magic Link Workflows:** Seamless invitation-based access eliminating password friction for SME clients and delegated professionals
- **Contextual Guidance:** Embedded help and validation that explains federal requirements without requiring prior REAP expertise
- **Status-Driven Navigation:** Interface adapts based on application state (document collection → professional review → payment → submission)
- **Role-Adaptive Interface:** Single platform provides different experiences for Account Admins, Managers, Consultants, SME Owners, and Professionals
- **Document-Centric Design:** Upload interfaces prioritized as primary interaction model for financial data and technical specifications

### Core Screens and Views
**Login/Registration Hub:** Simplified entry point with role-based routing to appropriate workflows
**Consultant Dashboard:** Application queue management with SME client assignment and progress tracking
**SME Application Wizard:** Guided document upload with professional invitation capabilities built-in
**Professional Delegation Interface:** Secure section-specific access for invited accountants/advisors/engineers
**Manager Overview Dashboard:** Team performance tracking with company-wide application pipeline visibility
**Payment Processing Flow:** Flexible payment routing with clear confirmation for all customer types
**Application Review Screen:** Final application preview before federal submission with professional contribution audit trail

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Meeting WCAG AA standards ensures rural SME owners with varying technical comfort levels can successfully navigate the platform, while also supporting consultant workflows in field conditions with diverse device capabilities.

### Branding
**Professional government-ready aesthetic** that instills confidence in federal compliance while maintaining approachable, non-intimidating design language. Visual hierarchy emphasizes **progress indicators** and **security badges** to counter rural users' concerns about data privacy and government paperwork complexity. Color palette balances **trust-building blues** with **agricultural greens** to resonate with rural SME contexts.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
**Primary:** Desktop/laptop for document-intensive workflows (financial uploads, professional contributions)
**Secondary:** Tablet optimization for consultant field usage during SME client meetings
**Tertiary:** Mobile phone support for status checking and basic navigation
**Technical Constraint:** Single responsive web application rather than native mobile apps due to 25-day development timeline

### Top Issues by Priority

**HIGH Priority:**
- **Government API Integration Error Handling:** Need specific fallback procedures for USDA database outages during peak application periods
- **Professional Liability Framework:** Require legal validation of audit trail sufficiency for professional services
- **AI Application Quality Validation:** Need sample REAP applications for template validation before development begins

**MEDIUM Priority:**
- **Mobile Responsive Performance:** Field consultant usage scenarios need validation with actual device testing
- **Professional Adoption Strategy:** Need specific plan for accountant/advisor onboarding and training
- **Payment Processing Edge Cases:** Handle failed payments during application generation process

**LOW Priority:**
- **Accessibility Testing Plan:** WCAG AA compliance validation approach could be more detailed
- **Customer Support Workflows:** Professional delegation technical support procedures

### MVP Scope Assessment

**Scope Appropriateness:** ✅ **Just Right**
- Core features directly address 25-day launch constraint
- Professional delegation system provides key differentiation
- Each epic delivers end-to-end value
- No feature bloat or unnecessary complexity

**Timeline Realism:** ✅ **Achievable**
- Epic structure supports 5-7 day development cycles
- Technical stack leverages team familiarity
- Template-based AI approach balances quality with speed

**Potential Scope Adjustments:**
- Advanced professional permissions could be simplified for MVP
- Manager dashboard analytics could be basic metrics only
- Civic engagement reminder could be text-only initially

### Technical Readiness

**Architecture Clarity:** ✅ **Excellent**
- Next.js + Convex + Stripe stack well-defined
- Professional delegation security model specified
- Technical preferences thoroughly documented

**Identified Technical Risks:**
- Professional access control complexity within timeline
- AI template quality requiring external REAP expertise
- Government API reliability during October 1st surge

**Areas for Architect Investigation:**
- Professional delegation database schema optimization
- Magic link security implementation details
- AI caching strategy for cost control

### Recommendations

**Before Development Begins:**
1. **Obtain REAP Expert Consultation:** Validate AI template approach with experienced REAP consultant
2. **Legal Review:** Confirm professional delegation audit trail meets liability requirements
3. **Government API Testing:** Verify USDA database access and develop fallback procedures

**During Epic 1:**
4. **Professional Delegation Schema Design:** Architect should prioritize granular access control design
5. **Magic Link Security Implementation:** Implement time-limited, single-use tokens with proper encryption

**During Epic 2-3:**
6. **Professional User Testing:** Conduct early validation with actual accountants/advisors
7. **AI Quality Validation:** Test template approach with sample financial documents

### Final Decision

✅ **READY FOR ARCHITECT**

The PRD is comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The epic breakdown provides clear implementation guidance while maintaining focus on the critical October 1st launch deadline. The professional delegation system represents appropriate competitive differentiation, and the technical stack aligns with team capabilities.
